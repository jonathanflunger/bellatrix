## Example Workflow
The sample scripts in example-scripts show how to use the program:


1st step: get a calibration.csv file by using peak_fitting.py

2nd step: do the calibration using calibration.py

3rd step: get the resolution of the detector using resolution.py

4th step: efficiency using efficiency.py

## Outputs

The plots are saved in the plots-directory.
